Introduction
------------
This folder contains debian packaging files for Qt Components Beta installation.
Qt Components Beta is just a new debian packaging name for Qt Components allowing
installation of any version of Qt Components on an environment with an existing
installation of Qt Components. This is a requirement if user wants to install a
custom version of Qt Components on a MeeGo device.

Build instructions
------------------
replace the qt-components/debian folder with this folder, i.e.
run these in qt-components folder:

mv ./debian ./debian_original
cp -r ./debian_original/debian_qt-components-beta ./debian

Then build with running this from qt-components folder:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -j3

If build is successful you should have bunch of qt-components-beta*.deb packages 
in parent folder.

Installation on a MeeGo device
------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: although these instructions have been tested on several devices with 
different base images this is still a somewhat dangerous operation. Use at own 
risk. Really!

1) On device set security -> developer mode and reboot as requested
2) Connect device via USB to host computer and select sdk mode
3) On host computer run 

sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.14

(if you lose the usb connection just rerun this, all terminal connections 
are restored without a need to reconnect)

4) Connect to 

ssh root@192.168.2.15

password: rootme

5) On host copy the debian packages to device with 

scp *.deb root@192.168.2.15:/opt

6) On device run 

export AEGIS_FIXED_ORIGIN=com.nokia.maemo

This allows user to install custom debian packages

7) On device install the packages with

dpkg -i --force-depends qt-components-beta_*.deb

(You only need to install the main qt components package)

8) On device run 

aegis-su -r tcb echo 0 >/sys/kernel/security/digsig/enabled

This allows the device to run custom binaries

9) Reboot the device

The device is now using qt-components-beta instead of the default qt components


Uninstallation
--------------
Tun on device: 

dpkg -r qt-components-beta


Implementation notes
--------------------
The qt components beta debian package installs this version of qt components
to folder

/opt/qt-components-beta/usr/lib/qt4/imports

The default qt components is overriden by setting environment variable
QML_IMPORT_PATH=/opt/qt-components-beta/usr/lib/qt4/imports

in 

/etc/profile.d/qt-components-beta.sh

This script is executed during device boot by

/etc/profile
